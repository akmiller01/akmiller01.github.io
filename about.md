## About Me

Hi, I’m Alex Miller, a data scientist with a passion for using technology to drive change in the humanitarian and development sectors. For over a decade, I’ve honed my skills in econometrics, public policy, data science, machine learning, and geospatial information systems to help organizations understand and act on some of the world’s most pressing issues.

I earned my Master's in Public Policy and a Bachelor's in International Relations at the College of William & Mary. I’ve spent a significant part of my career working with international datasets and open data standards, developing tools that allow analysts and policy makers to better understand complex data. I have previously worked at AidData, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), and Development Initiatives (DI).

I've worked on topics including malnutrition while making interactive data visualizations for the Global Nutrition Report, identifying cases of pre-arranged disaster financing within Official Development Assistance using natural language processing for the Centre for Disaster Protection, and predicting changes in displacement due to climate change using tabular transformers for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

I’ve also had the privilege to work across different countries, including collaborating with Ugandan developers on database user interface tools, which was a fantastic opportunity to learn from and contribute to new working methods.

If you are interested in working together with me on a new data science project, please don't hesitate to email me at [alex.k.miller@gmail.com](mailto:alex.k.miller@gmail.com){:target="_blank"} or reach out on my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-miller-7b781059){:target="_blank"}.
